\subsection{Natural Magnetic Remanence}
\label{Sec:Remanence}
Some rocks and other materials show a remanent magnetization additional to the induced magnetization by the contemporary Earth's magnetic field. The total magnetic moment is the superposition of the two. This has important implications for the interpretation of magnetic anomalies (see below), but can also be exploited for a number of important findings in paleomagnetics shaping our understanding of processes in the Earth System. Find an applications in which remanence helps us to understand the Earth's history (e.g., in terms of plate tectonics or dating) and post a short snapshot (pictures, key messages) of this in the forum. Don't post it if somebody else already did.
