\subsection{Geoelectric Array Types}
(a) Show explicitly that for a Wenner ($\alpha$) array the geometry factor is $K = 2\pi a$ where $a$ is the distance between between all electrodes.

(b) In preparation of the applied exercises, make a table with the different array types (Wenner $\alpha$, Schlumberger, and half-Schlumberger (or pole-dipole), and dipole-dipole). Without going into too much detail, mention two importantpoints that require consideration when choosing a specific type.
