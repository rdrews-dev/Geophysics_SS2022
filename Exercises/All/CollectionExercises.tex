    Exercises are an important part of the Geophysics lecture. They will treat some aspects of the lecture in more detail, but also cover new ground. We expect that you work on the exercises at home and we will discuss questions and solutions interactively together. Questions that are marked with 'Extra' are not required but geared to stir
     your further interest. We will surely support you if you tackle those as well.
